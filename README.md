# PlusMinus Space and Time Complexity Analysis

# Time Complexity
The time complexity is determined by the loop that iterates through the elements of the input list. The loop iterates once for each element in the list, so it has a time complexity of O(n). 
# Space Complexity
The space complexity of this problem is determined by the space used for the input list arr, as well as the variables. arr consumes space proportional to its size, which is n. So, its space complexity is O(n). The variables n, positive, negative, zero, positiveRatio, negativeRatio, and zeroRatio are all simple integers and doubles, which have constant space complexity, so their space complexity is O(1). the total space complexity is O(n) + O(1), which simplifies to O(n).
